*Note - SaMD has certain exclusions, and SiMD is scoped to on-device software/firmware, so there is definitely an 'OTHER' category not discussed here.*

**SaMD: Software _as_ medical device**
- Software designed for medical purpose, operating independently of physical medical device hardware.
- Might be running on a phone, desktop computer, or it could be a cloud-based system
- Eg - Application which interprets images to detect cancer
- Eg - Software that analyzes patient data to recommend medication dose
- Eg - Health monitoring app which measures/tracks blood glucose levels and issues warnings.

**SiMD: Software _in_ medical device**
- Software essential for operation of a hardware device, typically critical to performance / reliability.
- Eg - Firmware controlling infusion pump dose & timing.
- Eg - Ultrasound machine software processing and enhancing images for display
- Eg - Operating system for blood analysis device which manages tests & interprets data

Both SaMD and SiMD require a 09102405251 Software BOM (SBOM)
